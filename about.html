           <p>
               I earn a living by creating custom brands and logo designs from scratch, as well as
               designing and building high quality websites and blogs, but I also enjoy producing the odd
               t-shirt graphic, illustration or character design. I pride myself in having the nerdy skills
               to build top notch creations online, as well as being knowledgeable in the print side of
               design.
